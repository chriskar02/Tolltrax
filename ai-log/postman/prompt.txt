How would I use postman for this project


AI:

Postman is a powerful tool for testing APIs and can be very useful for your project to test your backend endpoints (like the ones in analytics.js) and ensure they work as expected. Here's how you can use Postman for your project:
Step 1: Set Up Postman

    Open Postman after installation.
    Create a new workspace (optional) to organize your project.
    Use the "Collections" feature to group all API requests related to your project.

Step 2: Test Your Backend Endpoints
1. Add a New Request

    Click on "New" > "Request" in Postman.
    Choose the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, etc.) based on the endpoint you're testing.
    Enter the URL of your API endpoint:
        If you're running your backend locally, the base URL will likely be:

text
http://localhost:3000

Example endpoint for user analytics:

        text
        http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/user

2. Add Query Parameters
For endpoints that require query parameters (e.g., fromDate and toDate), add them in Postman:

    Go to the Params tab.
    Add key-value pairs for the query parameters:
        Key: fromDate, Value: 2023-01-01
        Key: toDate, Value: 2023-12-31

Example for /api/analytics/user:

text
http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/user?fromDate=2023-01-01&toDate=2023-12-31

3. Add Headers
If your backend uses authentication (e.g., JWT tokens), add an authorization header:

    Go to the Headers tab.
    Add a key-value pair:
        Key: Authorization, Value: Bearer <your_token>

4. Send the Request

    Click on the orange Send button.
    View the response in the bottom panel.

Step 3: Test Specific Endpoints
Here are examples of how to test different endpoints in your project:
1. Test User Analytics Endpoint
Endpoint:

text
GET /api/analytics/user

Steps:

    Set the method to GET.
    Enter the URL:

    text
    http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/user

    Add query parameters (fromDate and toDate) in the Params tab.
    Add an authorization header if required.
    Click Send and check if you get user-specific data like balance and passthrough history.

2. Test Operator Station Popularity
Endpoint:

text
GET /api/analytics/operator/station-popularity

Steps:

    Set the method to GET.
    Enter the URL:

    text
    http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/operator/station-popularity

    Add query parameters (fromDate and toDate) in the Params tab.
    Add an authorization header with an operator's token.
    Click Send and check if you get station popularity data for that operator's stations.

3. Test Admin Station Popularity
Endpoint:

text
GET /api/analytics/admin/station-popularity

Steps:

    Set the method to GET.
    Enter the URL:

    text
    http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/admin/station-popularity

    Add query parameters (fromDate and toDate) in the Params tab.
    Add an authorization header with an admin or analyst's token.
    Click Send and check if you get station popularity data across all stations.

4. Test Vehicle Type Rankings
Endpoint (Admin):

text
GET /api/analytics/admin/vehicle-type-rank

Endpoint (Operator):

text
GET /api/analytics/operator/vehicle-type-rank

Steps:

    Set the method to GET.
    Enter either of these URLs based on role:
        Admin:

text
http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/admin/vehicle-type-rank

Operator:

        text
        http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/operator/vehicle-type-rank

    Add query parameters (fromDate and toDate) in the Params tab.
    Add an authorization header with a valid token.
    Click Send and verify that vehicle type rankings are returned.

5. Test Heatmap Data
For endpoints that provide heatmap data (e.g., station popularity with lat/lon), follow similar steps as above, ensuring that latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) are included in the response.
Step 4: Organize Requests into Collections
To keep things organized, create a collection in Postman for your project:

    Click on "New" > "Collection".
    Name it something like "Tollway Analytics API".
    Save all related requests (user, operator, admin) into this collection.

You can also group requests by role or functionality (e.g., "User Analytics", "Operator Analytics", etc.).
Step 5: Automate Testing with Postman
Postman allows you to write test scripts to validate responses automatically.
Example Test Script for Station Popularity Endpoint
In Postman's Tests tab, add this script to validate that latitude and longitude are present in each response object:

javascript
pm.test("Response contains lat and lon", () => {
  const response = pm.response.json();
  response.forEach((station) => {
    pm.expect(station).to.have.property("lat");
    pm.expect(station).to.have.property("lon");
  });
});

When you click Send, Postman will run this test automatically.
Step 6: Debugging Errors
If any request fails, Postman will display detailed information about what went wrong (e.g., incorrect URL, missing headers, etc.). Use this information to debug your backend or adjust your requests.
Step 7: Share API Documentation
Postman allows you to generate API documentation from your collection:

    Select your collection in Postman.
    Click on the "..." menu > "Publish Docs".
    Share the generated link with your team or use it as reference documentation.

Example Workflow Using Postman

    Start your backend server (node app.js).
    Open Postman and test endpoints like /api/analytics/user or /api/analytics/operator/station-popularity.
    Verify responses include all necessary data (e.g., balance, lat/lon, passthrough counts).
    Use filters like date ranges (fromDate, toDate) to test different scenarios.
