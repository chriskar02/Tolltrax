The error means that the exec function you're using in your dumpDatabase function isn’t available at runtime. This happens when Node’s child_process module isn’t properly imported or—if your code is bundled into the browser—it won’t be available at all. To resolve the issue:

    Import exec in db.js:
    At the very top of your db.js file, add the following line so Node knows what exec is:
         const { exec } = require("child_process");
    Ensure Server-Side Execution:
    Confirm that your dumpDatabase function is running on the server and not sent to the browser (for example, via a bundler or in an Electron renderer without node integration). The child_process module is a Node.js feature and won’t work in a browser context.

Once you’ve added the import and ensured the code runs on your backend, the exec function should be defined and able to run your pg_dump command as intended.
